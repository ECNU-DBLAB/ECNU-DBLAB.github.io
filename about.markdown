## Search on Sorted Data

Search on Sorted Data (SOSD) is a new benchmark that allows researchers
to compare their new (learned) index structures on both synthetic and real-world datasets. It is provided 
as C++ open source code that incurs little overhead (8 instructions and 1 cache miss per lookup), comes 
with diverse synthetic and real-world datasets, and provides efficient baseline implementations. 

The original SOSD paper can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.13014), and our detailed findings of learned 
index performance on SOSD datasets can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.12804).
